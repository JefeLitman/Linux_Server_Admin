# Linux Server Admin Guides
Repository containing documentation, scripts and other elements I consider elemental and determine a good configuration for linux servers.

## To do:
* [x] Create the `rm_user_dir` script to automatically delete user from a server.
* [x] Create the `remove_docker` script to uninstall rootless docker installation.
* [ ] Finish the `remove_docker` script.
* [ ] Add the current scripts already created.
* [ ] Format and versioning the already created scripts.
* [ ] Finish the `remove_docker` script.
* [ ] Upgrade `new_user` script to install docker directly instead of accessing the newly created user.
* [ ] Upgrade `new_user` and `rm_user_dir` to update `/etc/fstab` entries.
* [ ] Upload the guideline documents to the repo.
* [ ] Finish the redaction of guideline documents.
* [ ] Document regarding the cron task of scrubbing each month and make it default at false, similarly with trim. (ls -laR /etc/cron* to find the cron tasks)
